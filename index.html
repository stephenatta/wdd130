                Ghana, located in West Africa, is known for its rich history, vibrant culture, and diverse landscapes. It was the first African country to gain independence from colonial rule in 1957 and has since become a symbol of African liberation. 
                Ghana is famous for its gold, cocoa, and oil resources, contributing to its growing economy. The country is also known for its friendly people, colorful festivals, traditional music, and dance. With a coastline along the Atlantic Ocean, Ghana boasts beautiful beaches, while its interior is marked by lush forests, savannas, and wildlife. The capital city, Accra, is a bustling hub of commerce and culture.
